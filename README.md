# Weather

This React app displays data provided by the [OpenWeather One Call API 3.0](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3).

Specifically for my purposes, I'm pairing this with a custom WordPress plugin [salcode/myweather](https://github.com/salcode/myweather), which exposes the OpenWeather data via a REST API endpoint on a WordPress website.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
